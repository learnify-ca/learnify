## Issues and Feature Requests
We love to hear from our customers! Let us know about any feature requests you have for us. Start by creating an [issue](https://github.com/learnify-ca/learnify/projects/1). After creating an issue, you can track its status in our [Public Feature Request](https://github.com/learnify-ca/learnify/projects/1) project.

Feature requests have the following statuses:

### Deferred

### Pending
`Pending` requests have not yet been reviewed by the product team.

### Accepted
`Accepted` requests have been approved by the product team and will be added to the team's workflow. If a contact email has been left, we will notify you of the request's approval.

### Actively Building
`Actively Building` means the feature request has been integrated into the product team's workflow, and is currently being developed and tested.

### Deployed
